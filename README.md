#### üõ†Ô∏è Synthetic Data Preparation Logic

1. **Shut-In Events**  
  - Random shut-in periods are generated based on the configured count.

2. **Pressure Calculation**  
  - Well Head and Tubing pressures are computed using the initial values and decline rates.
  - Calculated as: 
    `Initial Pressure - decline rate * factor`

3. **Flow Rate Simulation**  
  - Calculated as:  
    `500 (base flow rate) - (well head pressure decline * 0.2)`  
  - This models real-world productivity decay.

4. **Temperature Simulation**  
  - Computed as:  
    `60 (base temp) + 0.2 * flowrate + random value between 0 to 0.5`

5. **Shut-In Adjustments**  
  When the well is shut in:
  - **Rise Factor**:  
    `1 - exp(- shut-in duration (in hours))`  
    Used to gradually **increase pressure** over time.
  - **Flow Decay Factor**:  
    `exp(-2 * shut-in duration (in hours))`  
    Used to gradually **decrease flow rate**.

  Applied Modifications:
  - Well Head Pressure: `+ 150 * rise factor + random(0, 3)`
  - Tubing Pressure: `+ 100 * rise factor + random(0, 2)`
  - Flow Rate: `* decay factor + random(0, 2)`

üîç Code: [data_simulator/__init__.py](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/data_simulator/__init__.py).

#### üßÆ Data Corruption Logic

1. **Missing Value Insertion**  
  - Drops random records based on a configurable **missing rate** (default: `1%`).

2. **Data Spike Insertion**  
  - Randomly selects records and applies spikes:  
    `¬± (magnitude √ó standard deviation)`

Corruption is applied per stream (e.g., FlowRate, Pressure, Temperature) to emulate sensor errors.

üîç Code: [data_corruptor.py](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/data_simulator/data_corruptor.py)

#### üßÆ Anomaly Injection Logic

To simulate realistic operational disruptions, the pipeline injects both point and continuous anomalies into the synthetic dataset:

1. **Point Anomalies**  
  - Sudden, short-lived deviations in sensor readings (e.g., pressure spikes or drops).

2. **Continuous Anomalies**  
  - Gradual or sustained deviations over a time window (e.g., overheating, tubing collapse).

3. **Log Association**  
  - Some anomalies are paired with synthetic engineer logs to simulate real-world diagnostics.
  - These logs are later used for semantic summarization in the prediction tab.

##### üîç Anomaly Types

| Type             | Description                               | Category     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------|
| TubingBlockage   | Restriction causing flow drop & TP rise   | Gradual      |
| ChokeErosion     | Surging flow rate due to orifice wear     | Gradual      |
| LiquidLoading    | Hydrostatic loading, flow collapse        | Gradual      |
| TubingCollapse   | Sudden shutdown, TP spike                 | Point        |
| OverHeating      | Localized temp spikes near ESP            | Point        |
| SandProduction   | Abrupt pressure/flow noise from solids    | Point        |

üîç Code: [data_simulator/anomaly_injector.py](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/data_simulator/anomaly_injector.py)

#### üßÆ Maintenance Log Embedding & Summarization

As the final step in the synthetic data pipeline, the system embeds and summarizes maintenance logs using a transformer-based language model.

1. **Log Embedding**  
  - Each engineer log is embedded using a pretrained transformer model (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
  - Embeddings are used to compute **semantic similarity** between logs and selected anomalies.

üîç Code: [data_simulator/__init__.py](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/data_simulator/__init__.py).

### üìà Data Visualization

Visualize the **synthetic time series data** to observe trends, identify signal behaviors, and analyze induced anomalies across the simulation period.

Each anomaly type comes with its own toggle, allowing fine-grained control over the visualization:

- ‚úÖ **Anomaly Toggles**: Enable or disable background highlights (rectangular overlays) for each anomaly type individually.
- üïí **Time Axis Exploration**: Inspect how different sensor signals change over the data generation window.
- üéØ **Anomaly Context**: Highlighted periods correspond to time spans where anomalies were synthetically injected, aiding correlation and interpretability.

#### üß© Model Inference Workflow

The model inference pipeline is structured into five sequential steps that transform raw sensor data into interpretable anomaly predictions with semantic links to known failure modes.

##### üßπ Step 1: Preprocessing
Raw sensor data is first standardized to ensure stability and consistency across downstream models.

- **Imputation**: Handles missing values using `ffill`, `interpolate`, or leaves them as-is.
- **Denoising**: A rolling median filter is applied to smooth out sharp noise while preserving signal structure. Points that deviate beyond `threshold √ó MAD (Mean Abs Deviation)` from the local median are replaced, reducing transient spikes.
- **Scaling**: Normalizes feature ranges for algorithms sensitive to variance to identify anomalies.

üîç Code: [Data Preparation](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/anomaly_detection/data_preparation.py)


##### üìç Step 2: Point Anomaly Detection
Detects short-lived, spike-like deviations using fast statistical and ensemble-based methods.

- **Z-score Algorithm**: Flags outliers exceeding a configurable standard deviation threshold.
- **Isolation Forest**: Detects anomalous data points using data partitioning, influenced by a contamination hyperparameter.

üîç Code: [Point Modeller](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/anomaly_detection/point_modeller.py)


##### üìà Step 3: Continuous Anomaly Detection
Identifies prolonged deviations using an LSTM-based autoencoder.

- Trained on normal sequences to learn reconstruction patterns.
- Sequences with high reconstruction error are labeled as anomalous.
- Highly configurable: window size, epochs, early stopping, and batch size.

üîç Code: [Continuous Modeller](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/anomaly_detection/continuous_modeller.py)


##### üß¨ Step 4: Embedding Anomaly Snapshots
Transforms both predicted anomalies and labeled (ground-truth) anomalies into dense vector embeddings using a transformer model.

- Embeddings capture temporal patterns and semantic behavior of anomalies.
- Enables contextual comparison between predicted vs. known signatures.

üîç Code: [Embeds](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/anomaly_detection/embed.py)


##### üß† Step 5: Nearest Neighbor Matching
Links predictions to likely root causes by comparing embeddings.

- Uses **cosine similarity** to find the closest labeled anomaly for every predicted anomaly.
- Facilitates interpretability by surfacing the most semantically aligned known failure mode.

üîç Code: [Embeds](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/anomaly_detection/embed.py)

### üìã Summarize Predictions 

Explore model predictions overlaid on sensor data in a time series view.

- üñçÔ∏è **Lasso Selection**: Use lasso select to highlight regions of interest within the time series.
- üìÑ **Dynamic Data Table**: Once a region is selected, a table populates with the corresponding anomalies detected in that window.
- üß† **Summarization Trigger**: Click **Summarize** to initiate a summary generation using the `llama3.1` language model.
- üîé **Semantic Log Extraction**: Relevant logs are semantically ranked based on anomaly context and summarized accordingly.
- üìå **Summary Output**: Generated summaries are displayed at the bottom of the tab for easy review and analysis.

<img src="img/summarizer.png" alt="Model Summarizer Tab" width="80%"/>
<img src="img/summarizer-1.png" alt="Model Summarizer Tab 1" width="80%"/>
</p>

#### üß† Summarization Logic (LLM-Powered)

The final step in the workflow generates human-readable summaries of selected anomaly windows using a transformer-based language model.

1. **Input Preparation**  
  - Extracts and flattens relevant fields: `SimilarAnomalyTypes`, `SimilarMaintenanceNotes`, and `SimilarObservations`.
  - Deduplicates and formats them into a structured prompt.

2. **Prompt Engineering**  
  - Constructs a prompt that guides the model to produce a one-line summary and a short explanation.

3. **Summarization**  
  - Uses `llama3.1` quantized via ollama `(which runs locally)` to generate concise, context-aware summaries.

üîç Code: [`summarize_predictions()`](https://github.com/vishnu-palagiri/OilRigAnomalyDetection/blob/main/data_simulator/__init__.py)

## üß† LLM Summarization Example

Uses `llama3.1` to generate concise insights like:

> ‚ÄúFlow rate dropped gradually with rising tubing pressure. Signs suggest a tubing blockage potentially due to wax deposition.‚Äù

Prompt templates include anomaly types, observation phrases, and maintenance notes matched via cosine similarity.
